STaR is an C# application designed to aid data collection for experiments involving human physiotherapy/anatomy using the Microsoft Kinect. It is akin to a VCR, except for skeleto-muscular data gathered from the Kinect device. It also supports a variety of other data streams, and will log all streams to a variety of formats (including CSV).

The main core of StaR is `rhapsody`, which is a interface-agnostic library for skeletal data collection, processing and recording.
